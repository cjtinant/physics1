## Chapter 5 - Application of Newton's Laws of Motion - Part II 

`r newthought('application of Newtons laws of motion')` describes why the sifaka, a lemur (old-world monkey) from Madagascar, spreads out its arms and legs in front of itself while making spectacular leaps from tree to tree.

`r newthought('The student learning outcome')` is **SLO2:**	Use Newton’s law of motion to analyze objects in dynamic equilibrium and undergoing acceleration.

`r newthought('Weekly Learning Objectives')` are to:

* Solve problems with sliding and rolling friction, and understand how
static friction can prevent motion;

* Use the linear and quadratic models of drag to solve problems
about motion through a fluid and to calculate terminal speeds; 

* Use Newton’s third law to identify forces on and to solve problems about interacting objects;


`r newthought('Homework is due')` on the Friday following the next class period.  Please upload homework assignments as a pdf to Google Scholar.  You can either scan your assignment or take a picture of your assignment and convert it to a pdf.  If you have an iPhone, tap on the ‘Share’ icon, then share to iBooks to automatically convert the jpg to a pdf.  

`r newthought('Week one problems')` Chapter 5 problems #: 27, 33, 39, 41, 43.    

`r newthought('Looking forward to next week')` we will begin Chapter Six.

\newpage 
 
`r newthought('The roughness of a surface exerts friction')` parallel to and in the opposite direction of the direction it is moving. Resting friction force is called static friction. ^[$\vec{f_s} = \mu_sn)$] Sliding friction force is called kinetic friction. ^[$\vec{f_k} = \mu_kn$] Rolling friction force is called rolling friction. ^[$\vec{f_r} = \mu_rn$] ^[Rolling friction is always less than kinetic friction which is always less than static friction.] 


`r newthought('As an object moves through a fluid')` like air or water, the resistive force is called *drag*. ^[Drag force is in the opposite direction of motion.] Drag consists of two different forces.  *Inertial forces* dominate for objects moving rapidly.  *Viscous forces* dominate for objects moving slowly.  To find which force dominates, find the Reynolds number ^[$R_e = \frac{F_{inertia}}{F_{viscious}} = \frac{\rho v^2 L^2}{\eta Lv} = \frac{\rho v L}{\eta}$], the *ratio* between inertial forces and viscous forces.  

`r newthought('Objects at a high Reynolds number')` are subject to inertial forces ^[$\vec{D} = \frac{1}{2}C_{D} \rho A v^2$]
