## Chapter 5 - Application of Newton's Laws of Motion - Part II 

`r newthought('application of Newtons laws of motion')` describes why the sifaka, a lemur (old-world monkey) from Madagascar, spreads out its arms and legs in front of itself while making spectacular leaps from tree to tree.

`r newthought('The student learning outcome')` is **SLO2:**	Use Newton’s law of motion to analyze objects in dynamic equilibrium and undergoing acceleration.

`r newthought('Weekly Learning Objectives')` are to:

* Solve problems with sliding and rolling friction, and understand how
static friction can prevent motion;

* Use the linear and quadratic models of drag to solve problems
about motion through a fluid and to calculate terminal speeds; 

* Use Newton’s third law to identify forces on and to solve problems about interacting objects;

`r newthought('Looking forward to next week')` we will begin Chapter Six.

\newpage 
 
`r newthought('The roughness of a surface exerts friction')` parallel to and in the opposite direction of the direction it is moving. Resting friction force is called static friction. ^[$\vec{f_s} = \mu_sn)$] Sliding friction force is called kinetic friction. ^[$\vec{f_k} = \mu_kn$] Rolling friction force is called rolling friction. ^[$\vec{f_r} = \mu_rn$] ^[Rolling friction is always less than kinetic friction which is always less than static friction.] 


`r newthought('As an object moves through a fluid')` like air or water, the resistive force is called *drag*. ^[Drag force is in the opposite direction of motion.] Drag consists of two different forces.  *Inertial forces* dominate for objects moving rapidly.  *Viscous forces* dominate for objects moving slowly.  To find which force dominates, find the Reynolds number ^[$R_e = \frac{F_{inertia}}{F_{viscious}} = \frac{\rho v^2 L^2}{\eta Lv} = \frac{\rho v L}{\eta}$], the *ratio* between inertial forces and viscous forces.  Inertial forces depend on fluid density, ^[$\rho$] speed, ^[$v$], and size of the object. ^[$L$]  Viscous forces depend on fluid viscosity, which is *very* temperature dependant. ^[$\eta$] 

`r newthought('Objects at a high Reynolds number')`, ^[$Re \geq 1000$] like thrown baseballs and fish,  are subject primarily to inertial forces as the object has to push the fluid out of its way. ^[$\vec{D} = \frac{1}{2}C_{D} \rho A v^2$] High Reynolds number drag coefficients ^[$C_D$] are dimentionless and empirically derived, and depend on the shape of the object, with more aerodynamic ^[bullet-shaped] shapes having lower drag coefficients.  The cross-sectional area is the area of the object you would see if the object is coming towards you.  As speed is squared in the equation, **the size of the drag force is proportional to the square of the object's speed.**  The drag force increases rapidly as the speed of the object increases until the object can no longer accelerate, having reached **terminal speed.**

`r newthought('Objects at a low Reynolds number')`, ^[$Re \leq 1$] like insects in water,  are subject primarily to inertial forces as the object has to push the fluid out of its way. ^[$\vec{D} = b \eta v$] Like $C_D$ above, low Reynolds number drag coefficients ^[$b$] are dimentionless and empirically derived, and depend on the shape of the object.  We often model objects traveling at low Reyolds number as spheres using a form of the equation above called **Stokes' Law.** ^[$\vec{D}_{sphere} =6 \pi \eta r v$]  Because objects at a low Reynolds number are moving in what feels like a thick syrup, they reach **terminal speed** almost instantaneously then moves at constant speed.  If the object stops applying force it quickly slows to a stop. ^[$\Delta t_{stop} = \frac{m}{6 \pi \eta r}$]
