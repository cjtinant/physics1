## Chapter 5 - Application of Newton's Laws of Motion 

`r newthought('application of Newtons laws of motion')` describes why the sifaka, a lemur (old-world monkey) from Madagascar, spreads out its arms and legs in front of itself while making spectacular leaps from tree to tree.

`r newthought('The student learning outcome')` is **SLO2:**	Use Newton’s law of motion to analyze objects in dynamic equilibrium and undergoing acceleration.

`r newthought('Weekly Learning Objectives')` are to:

* Solve problems about objects in equilibrium; 

* Use free-body diagrams, Newton’s second law, and the problem-solving approach to solve dynamics problems; 

* Work with and distinguish between mass and weight;

`r newthought('Homework is due')` on the Friday following the next class period.  Please upload homework assignments as a pdf to Google Scholar.  You can either scan your assignment or take a picture of your assignment and convert it to a pdf.  If you have an iPhone, tap on the ‘Share’ icon, then share to iBooks to automatically convert the jpg to a pdf.  

`r newthought('Week one problems')` Chapter 5 problems #: 3, 7, 9, 13, 17, 19, 25.

`r newthought('Looking forward to next week')` we will complete Chapter Five.

`r newthought('Forces are interactions')`, pushes and pulls, between **agents** and **objects**.  An object at rest with no net forces on it will stay at rest.  An object in motion with no net forces acting on it will continue moving in a straight line at constant speed. ^[**Newton's First Law**] Forces are in units called **newtons**. ^[1 newton = 1 N = $1 \frac{kg \times m}{s^2}$] ^[1 pound (force) = 1 lb = 4.45 N]

* Weight is caused by gravity and always points vertically downward.  ^[$\vec w = mg$] Your sensation of weight ^[the apparent weight] is the magnitude of the contact forces supporting an object. 

* Spring force is caused by the compression or tension of a spring.  

* Tension force is caused by a string or rope pulling on an object.  The direction of the tension force is in the direction of the string or rope.  

* Normal forceis the force exerted on an object by the surface it is resting on.  The normal force is perpendicular to the surface.  

* Thrust is the force of air expelled from a jet turbine or rocket that propels an object forward.  Thrust is in the direction opposite the direction of which the exhaust gas is expelled.  

* Electic and magnetic forces are long-range forces acting on charged particles.  ^[We will discuss these forces in detail in Physics II.]   


`r newthought('Forces cause objects to accelerate')`, to change their velocity.  A larger force causes a larger acceleration.  The connection between force and motion is described by ^[**Newton's Second Law**] $\vec{a} = \vec{F_{net}}/m$
 

`r newthought('Objects interact with one another')` as action/reaction pairs.  Every force occurs as one member of an action/reaction pair of forces. ^[**Newton's Third Law**]  The two members of the pair always act on *different* objects.  The two members of the action/reaction pair point in *opposite* directions and are *equal* in magnitude


`r newthought('For equilibrium problems')` the net forces equal zero because $\vec{a} = 0$.  Objects at rest or moving at constant velocity are at equilibrium.  
1. Use a picture   
2. Identify what is known and what you are trying to find   
3. Draw a free-body diagram   
4. Evaluate    ^[$\Sigma{F_x} = ma_x = 0$] ^[$\Sigma{F_y} = ma_y = 0$]   
5. Assess if result is reasonable

`r newthought('For dynamics problems')` the net forces do not equal zero because the object is accelerating.  $\vec{a} \neq 0$.  Find the net forces:  
1. Use a picture  
2. Identify what is known and what you are trying to find, often the force causing the aceleration ^[$$\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}$$]  
3. Draw a free-body diagram  
4. Evaluate, ^[$$\Sigma{F_x} = m \cdot a_x$$] ^[$$\Sigma{F_y} = m \cdot a_y$$]  
5. Assess if result is reasonable  


`r newthought('Free Body Diagrams')` should be drawn using a ruler to draw figures to scale, and a protractor to draw and measure angles.  FBDs should be a minimum of 3-inches by 3-inches. ^[to make your life easier...] ^[Tactics Box 4.2 discusses how to identify forces using free body diagrams.]
